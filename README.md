# Support

We would love contributions to our documentation. Writing clear, concise, and easy-to-translate documentation for a project like Solid can be tricky. It takes a community to make this possible. We encourage you to submit translations and edits as PRs
and to join the #_docs_ channel on the [Solid Discord](https://discord.com/invite/solidjs). A style guide and roadmap will be coming soon.

To start a translation project, create a folder with the language code in the `langs` folder of the project and copy English docs from the `en` folder. File structures must be maintained and content should be a direct translation without additions or modification of the original material. Kindly submit your contributions as PRs. A Solid team member and other native speakers of your language will have an opportunity to review your work before it's merged into the main branch.

If you feel the documentation is missing anything important, please feel free to open an issue or submit a modifying PR.

# Building

This package serves to build the markdown files into a consumable format imported by [solid-site](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-site).

Run `yarn build` to run the build script. This compiles the markdown into various json files in the `dist` folder and turns the `index.ts` file into an entry point that accesses them. Then, to view your changes in the context of the site, clone both repositories and run `yarn link` in the solid-docs directory and `yarn link solid-docs` in the solid-site directory.

### Theming
The script mentioned above uses shiki to process the code which in turn uses VSCode tokens. Therefore any VSCode theme can be applied.

All you have to do is retrieve the JSON file describing your favorite theme (see ./build/github-light.json for an example), paste it into the build folder and refer to it in the fetchReleases.ts file around line 158: const theme = await loadTheme(resolve(__dirname, 'your-theme.json'));.

## Importing Docs and Tutorials

The package exposes async functions to load the documentation using dynamic imports.

### `getDoc(lang: string, resource: string): Promise<DocFile | false>` 
Takes a language code matching a `langs` subdirectory and a resource name and returns a documentation file (see `src/types.ts`) if it exists. There are currently two existing resources, `api` and `guide`.

### `getTutorial(lang: string, lesson: string): Promise<LessonFile | false>`
Takes a language code and a lesson name and returns a lesson file if it exists. Each tutorial file has the `lesson` code files (the starting state of the code editor); the `solved` files, which show up when the user clicks the Solve button; and the lesson markdown itself.

Lesson names come from a lang folder's `tutorials/directory.json` file which can be imported using the following function.

### `getTutorialDirectory(lang: string): Promise<LessonLookup[] | false>`
Returns the directory object for language if it provides tutorials.

The package also exposes two arrays, `supportedTutorials` and `supportedDocs`, which tell you what language codes are supported for each.
